# Gophercises: Image Transformer

### Questions
* How well does this scale?
* Is there a better solution than setting SVG HTML dangerously?

### Neat Features
* I liked the elegance of the solution with Stdin and Stdout directly set to parsed request form and response writer.
* Spent a long time implementing a Preact client.

### Ideas
* Implement `legoize` as well as other image pipelines.
