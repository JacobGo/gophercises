# Gophercises: URL Shortener

### Questions
* Didn't realize that in Go you can return a func as a type as long as it has the arguments
* Unmarshaling the YAML was difficult. Is there any resource to learn best practices with wrangling data and types in Go?

### Neat Features
* Read YAML from file instead of a string

### Ideas
* Keep track of how many times a redirect is handled
* Allow users to submit their own URL shortening
* Optionally generate paths for URLs
* Ban circular references maybe?
